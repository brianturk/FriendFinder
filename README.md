# Friend Finder
Homework app using node express and heroku


## What this project does  
This project is a "Baseball Friend Finder".  The user answers 10 questions and then the application finds the saved user who is the closest match to them based on their answers.  In addition, it adds the user to the database of potential friends.

## Additional notes  
* This app is responsive.  I have tested it on my phone and the objects like the header logo shrink down appropriately.
* I did not do a modal dialog for the reveal as I felt that it would look better on the page
* I do not have a separate "survey" page as all functions are done from the one "index.html" page.  The user is welcomed, the survey is collected and the results are displayed.
* I went with a baseball theme to the match, but otherwise the logic is the same as required.
* I put a little testing data in the database which should be deleted if this is deployed
